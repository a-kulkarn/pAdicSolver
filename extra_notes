-- nullspace solvers in Hecke need to be replaces
-- bug in Hecke nullspace over finite field
-- bug in hensel_lift methods
-- bug in valuation.
-- need more flexible definitions for matrix type for convenience
-- constant difference between NEMO matrices and HECKE matrices is frustrating.



## Another idea: use forward iteration and a nullspace call. Possibly more stable than a solve call
   with a tiny eigenvalue.

## Backward solve with p-adic numbers seems unstable with small elements on the diagonal.
## Could be improved with an svd solver.
