-- nullspace solvers in Hecke need to be replaced
-- bug in Hecke nullspace over finite field
-- bug in hensel_lift methods
-- bug in valuation.
-- need more flexible definitions for matrix type for convenience
-- constant difference between NEMO matrices and HECKE matrices is frustrating.
-- precision loss in 0*0? Not clear what the correct behaviour here is...


## Another idea: use forward iteration and a nullspace call. Possibly more stable than a solve call
   with a tiny eigenvalue.

## Backward solve with p-adic numbers seems unstable with small elements on the diagonal.
## Could be improved with an svd solver.


** Endgame of inverse iteration needs adjustments. If the initial subspace in the iteration has dimension
larger than 1, this tends to cause problems. This scenario is "Zariski closed", but for small primes and
relatively small polynomial systems, there is actually a decent chance of this occurring accidentally.
